The fifth interview transcript with Interviewer Bharat Saini and Interviewee Alain

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] Bharat: Hey Alain, do you have a few minutes to spare? I am working on a project about STM in Montreal and I want to ask you a few questions regarding it.
    \item[] Alain: Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
    \item[] Bharat: May I know your age?
    \item[] Alain: I am 27.
    \item[] Bharat: Do you travel often by metro or bus?
    \item[] Alain: Yes, all the time. It is more convenient than owning a car.
    \item[] Bharat: How do you buy your passes? Do you use the vending machine or ask the metro customer service attendant? 
    \item[] Alain: It depends on which queue is shorter.
    \item[] Bharat: Which payment method do you use?
    \item[] Alain: I pay using my credit card.
    \item[] Bharat: We are working on an application that would make it possible to buy passes online. Would you consider using it?
    \item[] Alain: Yes, that would save a lot of time. 
    \item[] Bharat: Is there anything else you would like that application to do?
    \item[] Alain: It would be great if I could view my metro pass validity. I wonâ€™t have to use the vending machine at all then. 
    \item[] Bharat: That is an interesting suggestion. We are planning to implement that too. Thank you for your time. Have a good evening.
